Recently I took the AZ-900 MSFT Azure Fundamentals Exam. Here is a list of resources that I took to pass the exam in a week. If you want to get certified in Microsoft Azure Fundamentals then all you need to do is focus on a few things to make the journey helpful. 

The first thing you should do is look at the criteria under skills measured. You are marked on the following:

To pass the MSFT AZ-900 exam, you will need resources that will help you in clearing the exam. There are a lot of resources online and it depends on what kind of learner you are.
